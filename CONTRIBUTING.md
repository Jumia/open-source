# Contributing
**NOTE:** this is a template for contributing, each contributing file should be project oriented)

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited.

We encourage you to contribute to other open-source projects in ways that benefit Jumia.

Before writing a line of code to change a project, we highly recommend reaching out to the project maintainers via the Issues Tracker or [Slack Team](https://opensource-jumia.slack.com) and letting them know about your plans (many projects already require this as a first step).

## Pull Requests
[Pull Request template](https://github.com/:vendor:/:project:/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.MD)
* PSR-2 Coding Standard - Check the code style with $ composer check-style and fix it with $ composer fix-style.
* Add tests! - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
* Document any change in behaviour - Make sure the README.md and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
* Consider our release cycle - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
* Create feature branches - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
* One pull request per feature - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
* Send coherent history - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.
